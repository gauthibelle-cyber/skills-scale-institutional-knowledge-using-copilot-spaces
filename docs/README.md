# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme follows an **iterative, customer-first project management methodology** that prioritizes clarity, ownership, and continuous improvement. Our approach is built on several key principles:

- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments rather than monolithic releases
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead with defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Core Phases

Our project lifecycle follows these key phases:

1. **Initiation** — Validate business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan with a Project One-pager
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and align timelines
3. **Execution & Tracking** — Day-to-day delivery with regular standups, reviews, and progress tracking
4. **Release & Deployment** — Standardized process to minimize risk and ensure quality
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements
6. **Risk Management & Communication** — Ongoing identification, assessment, and communication of risks and dependencies

### Core Roles & Responsibilities

- **Project Manager (PM)** — Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, communications, and maintains transparency
- **Product Manager (PdM)** — Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, measures success, and owns product vision
- **Developers** — Design, build, test, and deliver features that meet acceptance criteria and quality standards
- **QA/Testing** — Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders** — Provide inputs, approvals, and strategic direction

### Key Artifacts

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items
